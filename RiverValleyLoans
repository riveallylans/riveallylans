The lending landscape has changed significantly due to financial technology, and it’s now possible to get a personal loan through an online bank.

Online banks offer many benefits, and sometimes offer more competitive interest rates, as they do not have the expenses associated with running physical branch locations. Consequently, cost-savings may be passed on to borrowers.

It’s also not unusual for online lenders to have faster processing times. Some provide a lending decision in a matter of minutes and funding the same day or in as little as 24 hours from the time of approval.
