In some cases, these loans are secured to protect the lender should you default on payments. There are also unsecured loans for those with less-than-ideal credit. Generally, the interest rates on loans for those with bad credit will be higher, or the fees may be steeper than what borrowers with good to excellent credit would be required to pay.

While it’s true that borrowers with solid credit scores are typically offered the most competitive interest rates on any type of lending, including personal loans, it is still possible to borrow money with a less-than-perfect credit score.
